# Event Adapter
================================
An event-based recyclerAdapter using an eventBus to notify it of any changes in the data source, letting the adapter show RecyclerViews nice animations (or you could add your own animations).
The library is meant to work with lollipop (api lvl 21) or above, but is planned for a Kitkat release later.

EventAdapter:

* Simplifies updating of adapters
* Can handle any kind of object
* Animates default animations when data is updated but can be expanded upon
* Minimizes data storage and handling
    
How to use:

Add to project with gradle

compile 'no.nordli:eventadapter:0.9'

Maven version might come later when milestones are reached.
